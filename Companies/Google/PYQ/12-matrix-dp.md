This is a variation of the **grid path counting** problem with directional constraints and optional mandatory checkpoints. Let's walk through the base problem and both follow-ups step by step.

## 🧭 Initial Problem: Unique Paths in a Grid

### 🔁 Moves Allowed:
From any cell `(i, j)` you may move to:
- Right: `(i, j+1)`
- Up-right: `(i-1, j+1)`
- Down-right: `(i+1, j+1)`

### 🧠 Goal:
Count all paths from the **bottom-left** `(n-1, 0)` to **bottom-right** `(n-1, m-1)` using the above moves.

---

## ✅ Base Solution (No Checkpoints)

### 💡 Dynamic Programming Approach:

Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of paths to reach cell `(i, j)`.

```go
dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] // from left
         + dp[i-1][j-1] if i-1 >= 0 // from up-left (diagonal up)
         + dp[i+1][j-1] if i+1 < n // from down-left (diagonal down)
```

### 🧮 Initialization:
`dp[n-1][0] = 1` since we start from bottom-left corner.

### 🔁 Traverse:
Column by column, build the table up to `(n-1, m-1)`.

---

### ✅ Go Implementation for Base Problem

```go
func countPaths(n, m int) int {
	dp := make([][]int, n)
	for i := range dp {
		dp[i] = make([]int, m)
	}
	dp[n-1][0] = 1 // Start at bottom-left

	for j := 1; j < m; j++ {
		for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
			if i > 0 {
				dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1]
			}
			dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1]
			if i < n-1 {
				dp[i][j] += dp[i+1][j-1]
			}
		}
	}

	return dp[n-1][m-1] // End at bottom-right
}
```

## 🔁 Follow-Up 1: Must Pass Through Checkpoints (Any Order)

Let’s say you are given `k` checkpoints: `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xk, yk)]`

### ✅ Strategy:
1. **Generate all permutations** of checkpoints.
2. For each permutation:
   - Count paths from start to first checkpoint.
   - Then from that checkpoint to next one.
   - … Until the last checkpoint to end.
3. **Sum all valid path combinations**.

### ⚠️ Challenge:
- You can’t directly use DP for the entire grid because some intermediate paths must go through fixed points.
- You need to compute `countPathsBetween(from, to)` for each pair of waypoints.

---

## 🧠 countPathsBetween(from, to) function:

You compute number of valid paths **from point A to point B**, again using the same DP technique but start from `A` and end at `B`.

But here, the same movement constraints apply.

---

## 🔁 Follow-Up 2: Ordered Checkpoints

You **don’t need to permute** anything. Just:
- From start → cp1 → cp2 → … → cpK → destination.

### ✅ Plan:
```go
totalPaths = 1
for i := 0; i <= k; i++:
    totalPaths *= countPathsBetween(checkpoints[i], checkpoints[i+1])
```

Where:
- checkpoints[0] = (n-1, 0)
- checkpoints[k+1] = (n-1, m-1)

## 🧠 Summary of Patterns

| Problem Variant         | Pattern/Approach                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Base Problem            | DP with directional transitions      |
| Unordered Checkpoints   | All permutations + segment DP        |
| Ordered Checkpoints     | Sequential segment DP                |
