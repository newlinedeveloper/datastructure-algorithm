Great question! Let's break this down clearly and provide a **Golang solution**, with full explanation and the **underlying pattern** this problem follows.

---

### ✅ Problem Summary

You're given:
- A string `pi` of digits, e.g. `"314159265359"`, with length up to `10^6`.
- You need to return a list of **1-based indexes `i`** where `pi[i-1...i+len(str(i))-2] == str(i)`.

#### Example:

If `pi = "314159265359"`  
Then at 1-based index `3`, we have:
- `i = 3` → string `"3"` (1-digit)
- `pi[2] = '4'` ≠ `'3'` → Not a match.

If `i = 314` → check:
- Does `pi[313] = '3'`, `pi[314] = '1'`, `pi[315] = '4'`?  
- i.e. does `pi[313:316] == "314"`?  
→ If yes, then 314 is added to the result.

---

### 🧠 Pattern / Algorithm Type

This is a classic example of:

#### ✅ **String Matching with Positional Constraint**
- You check if a **subsequence of the string** (with a sliding window) matches a **dynamically generated number (`i`)** at its respective 1-based position.
- Can be optimized using:
  - **String comparison**
  - No need for KMP or advanced pattern matching here
  - Just a linear scan and string slicing

---

### ✅ Optimized Golang Solution

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
)

func matchingIndexes(pi string) []int {
	n := len(pi)
	result := []int{}

	// Since maximum i such that i + len(str(i)) - 1 <= n
	// We loop i from 1 up to a point where slicing won't go out of bounds
	for i := 1; ; i++ {
		strI := strconv.Itoa(i)
		start := i - 1          // 1-based to 0-based index
		end := start + len(strI)

		if end > n {
			break // Can't match beyond bounds
		}

		if pi[start:end] == strI {
			result = append(result, i)
		}
	}

	return result
}

func main() {
	pi := "314159265359"
	result := matchingIndexes(pi)
	fmt.Println(result) // Example Output
}
```

---

### 💡 Explanation

- Loop from `i = 1` up to as long as `pi[i-1:i-1+len(str(i))]` is within bounds.
- Convert `i` to string: `strI := strconv.Itoa(i)`
- Check if the slice of `pi` starting at index `i-1` and of length `len(strI)` matches `strI`.
- If yes, append `i` to result.

---

### ⏱️ Time Complexity

- **O(N)** where N is the length of `pi`
- We only scan up to positions where a valid substring can be formed.
- Efficient even for `10^6` length input.

---

### 📦 Example

If `pi = "314159265359"`:

```
Check i=1 => pi[0] = "3" vs "1" → no
Check i=2 => pi[1] = "1" vs "2" → no
Check i=3 => pi[2] = "4" vs "3" → no
...
Check i=314 => pi[313:316] == "314" → YES → append 314
```

### ✅ Pattern Summary

| Concept               | Description                                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Pattern Type          | Sliding window + dynamic string generation        |
| Key Idea              | Match index value with a substring at that index  |
| Optimized Approach    | Avoid brute force by limiting scan to within bounds |

Let me know if you'd like a version that works with very large `pi` (streaming input, etc.) or enhanced with concurrency for even faster runtime.
