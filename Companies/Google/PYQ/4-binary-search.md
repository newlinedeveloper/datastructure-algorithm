Great question! This is a classic **binary search on the answer** problem. Let’s go step by step to understand it and then implement a solution in **Golang**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Summary

- You're given:
  - An array of integers, e.g., `nums = [7, 15, 10, 20]`
  - A **storage limit** `S`, like `S = 40`
- You must **choose a number `x`** such that:
  - Every number in the array is **replaced by `min(num, x)`**
  - The **total sum** after replacements is **≤ S**
- Find the **maximum possible `x`** that satisfies this condition.

---

## 💡 Intuition

We can observe:
- If you pick a **small x**, more numbers get truncated → smaller sum.
- If you pick a **large x**, fewer truncations → sum increases.

This is **monotonic behavior**, which is perfect for **binary search**.

---

## 🔍 Approach

1. **Binary search** on possible values of `x`, say from `0` to `max(nums)`
2. For each `x`, compute the **truncated sum**:  
   `sum(min(num, x) for num in nums)`
3. Compare this sum to `S`:
   - If it's **≤ S**, move right (try larger `x`)
   - If it's **> S**, move left (need smaller `x`)
4. Keep track of the **maximum valid `x`**

## ✅ Example

```text
nums = [7, 15, 10, 20]
S = 40

Try x = 10 → [7, 10, 10, 10] → sum = 37 ✅
Try x = 11 → [7, 11, 10, 11] → sum = 39 ✅
Try x = 12 → [7, 12, 10, 12] → sum = 41 ❌

So, max x = 11
```

---

## ✅ Golang Solution

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func findMaxX(nums []int, S int) int {
	// Binary search bounds
	lo, hi := 0, maxInArray(nums)
	answer := 0

	for lo <= hi {
		mid := (lo + hi) / 2
		sum := 0

		for _, num := range nums {
			if num > mid {
				sum += mid
			} else {
				sum += num
			}
		}

		if sum <= S {
			answer = mid // valid candidate
			lo = mid + 1 // try larger
		} else {
			hi = mid - 1 // sum too big, go smaller
		}
	}

	return answer
}

func maxInArray(nums []int) int {
	max := nums[0]
	for _, n := range nums {
		if n > max {
			max = n
		}
	}
	return max
}

// Test it
func main() {
	nums := []int{7, 15, 10, 20}
	S := 40
	fmt.Println("Max X:", findMaxX(nums, S)) // Output: 11
}
```

## 📦 Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * log(max(nums)))`
  - Each binary search iteration does `O(n)` work
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases

- `S` is greater than or equal to the sum of the original array → return `max(nums)`
- `S = 0` → return 0
- `nums = []` → undefined, handle separately
