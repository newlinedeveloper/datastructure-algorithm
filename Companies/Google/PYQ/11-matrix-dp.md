This is a variation of the **grid path counting** problem with directional constraints and optional mandatory checkpoints. Let's walk through the base problem and both follow-ups step by step.

## 🧭 Initial Problem: Unique Paths in a Grid

### 🔁 Moves Allowed:
From any cell `(i, j)` you may move to:
- Right: `(i, j+1)`
- Up-right: `(i-1, j+1)`
- Down-right: `(i+1, j+1)`

### 🧠 Goal:
Count all paths from the **bottom-left** `(n-1, 0)` to **bottom-right** `(n-1, m-1)` using the above moves.

---

## ✅ Base Solution (No Checkpoints)

### 💡 Dynamic Programming Approach:

Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of paths to reach cell `(i, j)`.

```go
dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] // from left
         + dp[i-1][j-1] if i-1 >= 0 // from up-left (diagonal up)
         + dp[i+1][j-1] if i+1 < n // from down-left (diagonal down)
```

### 🧮 Initialization:
`dp[n-1][0] = 1` since we start from bottom-left corner.

### 🔁 Traverse:
Column by column, build the table up to `(n-1, m-1)`.

---

### ✅ Go Implementation for Base Problem

```go
func countPaths(n, m int) int {
	dp := make([][]int, n)
	for i := range dp {
		dp[i] = make([]int, m)
	}
	dp[n-1][0] = 1 // Start at bottom-left

	for j := 1; j < m; j++ {
		for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
			if i > 0 {
				dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1]
			}
			dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1]
			if i < n-1 {
				dp[i][j] += dp[i+1][j-1]
			}
		}
	}

	return dp[n-1][m-1] // End at bottom-right
}
```

## 🔁 Follow-Up 1: Must Pass Through Checkpoints (Any Order)

Let’s say you are given `k` checkpoints: `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xk, yk)]`

### ✅ Strategy:
1. **Generate all permutations** of checkpoints.
2. For each permutation:
   - Count paths from start to first checkpoint.
   - Then from that checkpoint to next one.
   - … Until the last checkpoint to end.
3. **Sum all valid path combinations**.

### ⚠️ Challenge:
- You can’t directly use DP for the entire grid because some intermediate paths must go through fixed points.
- You need to compute `countPathsBetween(from, to)` for each pair of waypoints.

---

## 🧠 countPathsBetween(from, to) function:

You compute number of valid paths **from point A to point B**, again using the same DP technique but start from `A` and end at `B`.

But here, the same movement constraints apply.

---

## 🔁 Follow-Up 2: Ordered Checkpoints

You **don’t need to permute** anything. Just:
- From start → cp1 → cp2 → … → cpK → destination.

### ✅ Plan:
```go
totalPaths = 1
for i := 0; i <= k; i++:
    totalPaths *= countPathsBetween(checkpoints[i], checkpoints[i+1])
```

Where:
- checkpoints[0] = (n-1, 0)
- checkpoints[k+1] = (n-1, m-1)

## 🧠 Summary of Patterns

| Problem Variant         | Pattern/Approach                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Base Problem            | DP with directional transitions      |
| Unordered Checkpoints   | All permutations + segment DP        |
| Ordered Checkpoints     | Sequential segment DP                |

---

Would you like a full Go implementation for the **ordered checkpoint case**?

---

Absolutely! Let's walk through the **Go implementation** for **Follow-Up 2**, where checkpoints must be visited **in a specific order**.

---

## ✅ Problem Recap

You are on an `n x m` grid.  
You can move only:
- Right → `(dx=0, dy=1)`
- Diagonally up-right → `(dx=-1, dy=1)`
- Diagonally down-right → `(dx=+1, dy=1)`

You start from **bottom-left** `(n-1, 0)`  
You need to reach **bottom-right** `(n-1, m-1)`  
You **must pass through all the checkpoints in order**.

---

## 🧠 Plan
1. Implement `countPathsBetween(from, to)` using DP.
2. Multiply path counts between all consecutive waypoints:
   ```
   start -> cp1 -> cp2 -> ... -> cpK -> end
   ```

---

### ✅ Go Solution

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Direction vectors: right, up-right, down-right
var dirs = [][2]int{
	{0, 1},   // right
	{-1, 1},  // up-right
	{1, 1},   // down-right
}

// Count paths from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) with movement constraints
func countPathsBetween(n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2 int) int {
	// Initialize dp table
	dp := make([][]int, n)
	for i := range dp {
		dp[i] = make([]int, m)
	}
	dp[x1][y1] = 1

	for col := y1 + 1; col <= y2; col++ {
		for row := 0; row < n; row++ {
			dp[row][col] = 0
			for _, dir := range dirs {
				prevRow := row - dir[0]
				prevCol := col - dir[1]
				if prevRow >= 0 && prevRow < n && prevCol >= y1 && prevCol <= y2 {
					dp[row][col] += dp[prevRow][prevCol]
				}
			}
		}
	}
	return dp[x2][y2]
}

func totalOrderedPaths(n, m int, checkpoints [][2]int) int {
	// Add start and end to the full path
	fullPath := make([][2]int, 0)
	fullPath = append(fullPath, [2]int{n - 1, 0})           // start
	fullPath = append(fullPath, checkpoints...)             // ordered checkpoints
	fullPath = append(fullPath, [2]int{n - 1, m - 1})       // end

	total := 1
	for i := 0; i < len(fullPath)-1; i++ {
		from := fullPath[i]
		to := fullPath[i+1]
		if from[1] > to[1] {
			// invalid direction (can only go right), no path possible
			return 0
		}
		paths := countPathsBetween(n, m, from[0], from[1], to[0], to[1])
		total *= paths
	}
	return total
}

func main() {
	n, m := 5, 6
	checkpoints := [][2]int{
		{2, 2},
		{3, 4},
	}

	fmt.Println("Total paths through ordered checkpoints:", totalOrderedPaths(n, m, checkpoints))
}
```

---

## 🧪 Example
If:
- Grid is 5 rows × 6 columns
- Start = (4,0)
- End = (4,5)
- Checkpoints = (2,2), (3,4)

This computes how many paths start at `(4,0)`, go through `(2,2)` → `(3,4)` and end at `(4,5)`, following only allowed moves.

---

## 💡 Pattern / Techniques Used

- Dynamic Programming to compute paths from point A to B with custom movement rules.
- Path decomposition when constraints are imposed by intermediate checkpoints.
- Multiplicative path counting when order of visiting checkpoints is **fixed**.
