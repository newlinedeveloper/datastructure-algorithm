Thanks for the detailed description ‚Äî it‚Äôs very clear you understood the problem and designed a reasonable solution using BFS. Let‚Äôs break this down and provide:

1. **Problem Understanding**  
2. **Clarified Approach**  
3. **Golang Solution**  
4. **Time and Space Complexity**  
5. **Post-mortem Reflection** (if you'd like to talk more about handling the interview dynamic)

## ‚úÖ 1. Problem Statement Recap

You're given:

- A **map of routers**: `map[string][2]int` where key is router name, value is `(x, y)` coordinate.
- A **maximum range** (`maxRange`) for all routers.
- A `source` and `destination` router name.

A **signal can be broadcast** from router `A` to router `B` **only if**:
- `getDistance(A, B) <= maxRange` (we use a stubbed `getDistance` function ‚Äî probably using Euclidean distance).

---

## ‚úÖ 2. High-Level Approach

- **Model routers as nodes** in an **undirected graph**.
- **Two options**:
  - (A) **On-the-fly BFS**: For each node during BFS, iterate over all routers to find reachable ones (no upfront graph building).
  - (B) **Pre-build adjacency list**: O(N¬≤) upfront cost, O(N) traversal.

The interviewer **hinted toward building an adjacency list**, suggesting that the graph is **static** and pre-processing makes sense.

But your trade-off (space vs. time) in **not building the full graph** and checking neighbors dynamically is a valid strategy when:
- You want to save space.
- The input graph isn't reused.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Golang Solution (Using BFS + On-the-Fly Neighbor Detection)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

// GetDistance is a stub for calculating Euclidean distance
func getDistance(p1, p2 [2]int) float64 {
	dx := float64(p1[0] - p2[0])
	dy := float64(p1[1] - p2[1])
	return math.Sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)
}

func canReachDestination(routers map[string][2]int, maxRange float64, source, destination string) bool {
	if source == destination {
		return true
	}

	visited := make(map[string]bool)
	queue := []string{source}
	visited[source] = true

	for len(queue) > 0 {
		curr := queue[0]
		queue = queue[1:]

		for neighbor, coord := range routers {
			if !visited[neighbor] && getDistance(routers[curr], coord) <= maxRange {
				if neighbor == destination {
					return true
				}
				queue = append(queue, neighbor)
				visited[neighbor] = true
			}
		}
	}
	return false
}
```

## ‚úÖ Example Usage

```go
func main() {
	routers := map[string][2]int{
		"A": {0, 0},
		"B": {3, 0},
		"C": {6, 0},
		"D": {9, 0},
	}
	maxRange := 3.5
	source := "A"
	destination := "D"

	fmt.Println(canReachDestination(routers, maxRange, source, destination)) // true
}
```

## ‚úÖ 4. Time & Space Complexity

**Without Precomputing Neighbors (Your Approach)**:
- Time: O(N¬≤) in worst case ‚Äî for each node visited, we scan all routers.
- Space: O(N) for visited + queue

**With Adjacency List**:
- Preprocessing: O(N¬≤) time and O(N¬≤) space
- BFS traversal: O(N)

Which to use depends on the constraints. Your explanation was right ‚Äî if we avoid the space-heavy adjacency list, we can accept higher runtime per traversal.

---

## üß† 5. Interview Reflection

You're right to feel a little disappointed ‚Äî it seems the interviewer may have **missed the trade-offs** in your approach or wasn‚Äôt actively engaged. That said, some things to keep in mind:
- **Clarify constraints** early: e.g., "Should I optimize for space or time? Are we optimizing for repeated lookups or single queries?"
- **Be ready to switch approaches**: If interviewer nudges toward an adj list, say:  
  > ‚ÄúSure! Let me show how we can precompute that to make lookups O(1). It comes at a cost of O(N¬≤) space upfront.‚Äù

Let me know if you want:
- The **adjacency list** based version
- Dry-run visual of BFS
- Unit test setup for this

You're doing great ‚Äî this question definitely requires both graph and systems thinking!
