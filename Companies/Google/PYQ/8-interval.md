This is a great problem involving **geometry and interval partitioning**, where the main task is to determine **if there's a vertical line** that:

1. **Does not cut through any topping**
2. **Leaves at least one topping on each side** of the cut

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Breakdown

You're given a list of toppings where each topping is represented as:

```go
[startX, endX, startY, endY]
```

We need to find **a vertical line `x = cutX`** such that:
- It does **not pass through any topping** (i.e. not within any topping's horizontal bounds)
- It splits the cake such that both left and right halves contain at least one topping

---

## üí° Pattern / Approach

This is an example of a:

### üëâ **Sweep Line + Interval Separation** problem

### Steps:
1. **Sort toppings by `startX`**
2. Maintain a **sorted list of intervals** ‚Äî keep track of the **rightmost end (`maxEndX`)** so far.
3. Try every possible vertical line between two toppings to see if:
   - The cut line `cutX` is **between `endX of left topping` and `startX of right topping`**
   - No topping crosses that line
   - Left group has at least one topping, right group has at least one topping

## ‚úÖ Golang Solution

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

type Topping struct {
	startX int
	endX   int
	startY int
	endY   int
}

func canCutCake(toppings []Topping) bool {
	n := len(toppings)
	if n < 2 {
		return false
	}

	// Sort toppings by their startX
	sort.Slice(toppings, func(i, j int) bool {
		return toppings[i].startX < toppings[j].startX
	})

	// Track max right edge seen so far
	maxEndX := toppings[0].endX

	for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
		cutX := toppings[i].startX
		if cutX > maxEndX {
			// Valid vertical gap between maxEndX and current startX
			// Check that left group (0...i-1) and right group (i...n-1) exist
			if i > 0 && i < n {
				return true
			}
		}
		if toppings[i].endX > maxEndX {
			maxEndX = toppings[i].endX
		}
	}

	return false
}

func main() {
	toppings := []Topping{
		{0, 6, 0, 1},  // a
		{7, 8, 0, 4},  // b
		{0, 1, 2, 4},  // c
	}
	fmt.Println(canCutCake(toppings)) // Output: true
}
```

## üß† Explanation

### Example:
Input toppings:

```
a: (0,6,0,1)
b: (7,8,0,4)
c: (0,1,2,4)
```

- After sorting: a, c, b
- The rightmost end of a and c is `6`
- Next topping b starts at `7`
- So we can cut between `6` and `7`, which does **not cut** any topping.
- Left group: a, c; Right group: b ‚Üí ‚úÖ valid

## ‚è± Time & Space Complexity

- **Time:** O(N log N) ‚Äî for sorting
- **Space:** O(1) extra (we don't use extra space proportional to input size)

---

## üß© Pattern Summary

| Pattern | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sweep Line / Interval Merging** | We're essentially checking where non-overlapping intervals end and begin to find a clean vertical cut |
| **Greedy Max Tracking** | We keep track of the rightmost `endX` seen to detect gaps between intervals |

Let me know if you want to extend this to **horizontal cuts**, or count **number of valid cuts**!
