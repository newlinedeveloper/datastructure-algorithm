This is a classic problem that combines **combinatorics**, **dynamic programming**, and **bitmasking** to manage block placements and ensure the **"no vertical seam alignment"** constraint across layers.

---

## ðŸ§© Problem Breakdown

You're given:
- A list of available block lengths (`available_block_lengths`)
- A wall width `X`
- A wall height `H`

### ðŸš§ Constraints:
1. You can use any number of blocks from the list (infinite supply).
2. In each layer, you can build the width `X` using any permutation of the available blocks (as long as their total length is `X`).
3. Across layers, **no two layers can have block edges align vertically (except at the two ends)**.

---

## âœ… Solution Approach

### Step 1: Generate all valid rows
For a given width `X` and block lengths, generate all ways to form that row (layer) using block combinations that exactly sum to `X`.

- For each combination, store **where the breaks (seams)** happen.
- Represent these seams using **bitmasks** â€” useful for quick comparison later.

### Step 2: DP with Seam Compatibility
- Let `dp[h][mask]` be the number of ways to build height `h` where the last row has seams as `mask`.
- Transition: for every `prev_mask`, try placing a `next_mask` such that `prev_mask & next_mask == 0` (i.e., no vertical seams align).

### Step 3: Count all valid configurations at height `H`

## âœ¨ Go Code Implementation

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Generate all valid rows for width using available block lengths.
// Each row is represented by a bitmask of seam positions.
func generateRows(width int, blocks []int) []int {
	var results []int
	var dfs func(pos int, mask int)
	dfs = func(pos int, mask int) {
		if pos == width {
			results = append(results, mask)
			return
		}
		for _, b := range blocks {
			if pos+b <= width {
				newMask := mask
				if pos+b < width {
					newMask |= 1 << (pos + b)
				}
				dfs(pos+b, newMask)
			}
		}
	}
	dfs(0, 0)
	return results
}

// Count ways to build a wall of height H and width W using available blocks
func countWalls(width, height int, blocks []int) int {
	validRows := generateRows(width, blocks)

	dp := make(map[int]int)
	for _, mask := range validRows {
		dp[mask] = 1
	}

	for h := 1; h < height; h++ {
		nextDP := make(map[int]int)
		for prevMask, count := range dp {
			for _, mask := range validRows {
				if prevMask&mask == 0 { // no overlapping seams
					nextDP[mask] += count
				}
			}
		}
		dp = nextDP
	}

	// Sum all values in dp for height H
	total := 0
	for _, count := range dp {
		total += count
	}
	return total
}

func main() {
	availableBlocks := []int{1, 2}
	width := 3
	height := 3
	result := countWalls(width, height, availableBlocks)
	fmt.Println(result) // Output: 2
}
```

## ðŸ§  Time Complexity

- **Let `R` be the number of valid rows (bitmasks).**
- For `H` layers, the time is approximately:  
  **O(H Ã— R Ã— R)** â€” you compare every pair of valid rows for compatibility.

---

## ðŸ§  Pattern Identified

**Bitmask DP + Constraint Compatibility Transition**

This pattern is useful in problems like:
- Brick wall construction with alignment rules
- Layered structures with placement constraints
- Scheduling or seating problems with adjacency rules
