Great! Let’s break down the key concepts from **Heaps 1: Intro to Heaps, Trees, Rooting a Tree, Binary Tree, Complete Binary Tree** — which forms the foundation for understanding **heap data structures** and their applications in algorithms (like priority queues, Dijkstra’s, etc.).

## 🌲 1. Tree Basics

### ✅ Tree
- A **tree** is a connected, acyclic graph.
- **Rooted Tree**: A tree with one node designated as the **root**, and all edges directed away from it.
- Each node has:
  - **Parent**
  - **Children**

---

## 🌳 2. Binary Tree
A **binary tree** is a rooted tree where:
- Each node has at most **2 children**: `left` and `right`.

---

## 🌲 3. Complete Binary Tree
A binary tree is **complete** if:
- Every level is fully filled, **except possibly the last level**.
- The last level has all nodes **as far left as possible**.

### 🧠 Why do we care?
Heaps are built on complete binary trees because:
- They can be **stored efficiently in arrays**.
- Parent and child indices can be computed using formulas:
  - Parent of `i` → `(i - 1) / 2`
  - Left child of `i` → `2*i + 1`
  - Right child of `i` → `2*i + 2`

## 🔺 4. Heaps

### ✅ Min Heap
- A complete binary tree.
- Each node is **smaller than or equal to** its children.
- Root always contains the **minimum** value.

### ✅ Max Heap
- Each node is **greater than or equal to** its children.
- Root has the **maximum** value.

---

## 🔁 5. Heap Operations

### Insertion (Push)
- Add at the **end** of the array.
- "Bubble up" or **heapify up** to restore heap property.

### Deletion (Pop)
- Remove the **root**.
- Replace it with the **last element**.
- "Bubble down" or **heapify down**.

### Time Complexity:
- Insert: **O(log n)**
- Delete Min/Max: **O(log n)**
- Peek Min/Max: **O(1)**

## 📦 6. Heaps in Practice

### ✅ Use cases:
- Priority Queue (Dijkstra’s algorithm, A* pathfinding)
- Median Maintenance
- Heap Sort (O(n log n))
- Scheduling algorithms
- Event simulation

## 🛠️ Example (Min Heap in Go using container/heap)

```go
import (
	"container/heap"
	"fmt"
)

type IntHeap []int

func (h IntHeap) Len() int            { return len(h) }
func (h IntHeap) Less(i, j int) bool  { return h[i] < h[j] }
func (h IntHeap) Swap(i, j int)       { h[i], h[j] = h[j], h[i] }
func (h *IntHeap) Push(x any)         { *h = append(*h, x.(int)) }
func (h *IntHeap) Pop() any {
	old := *h
	n := len(old)
	x := old[n-1]
	*h = old[0 : n-1]
	return x
}

func main() {
	h := &IntHeap{2, 3, 1}
	heap.Init(h)
	heap.Push(h, 0)
	fmt.Println(heap.Pop(h)) // 0 (min element)
}
```
