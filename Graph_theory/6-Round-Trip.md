Absolutely! Let's go through **CSES Problem 1669: Round Trip** step-by-step. This problem is about **detecting and retrieving a cycle** in an **undirected graph**.

---

## 🔍 Problem Summary: Round Trip (CSES 1669)

You’re given an undirected graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges. Your task is to **find a cycle** (if it exists) and print the nodes that form the cycle.

If no cycle exists, print `IMPOSSIBLE`.

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

- This is a **cycle detection** problem in an **undirected graph**.
- When using **DFS**, to detect a cycle in an undirected graph, make sure to **ignore the immediate parent** to prevent false positives.
- If a visited node is encountered that is not the parent, a cycle exists.
- To **retrieve the cycle**, use a **parent array** to reconstruct the path.

## 🧪 Sample Input

```
5 6
1 2
1 3
2 3
1 4
4 5
3 5
```

### 🔄 Sample Output

```
4
3 2 1 3
```

Explanation: One of the cycles found is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1`.

## ✅ Plan

1. Build an adjacency list.
2. Use DFS to traverse the graph.
3. If a back edge is found (to a visited node that is not the parent), a cycle is detected.
4. Use a parent map to reconstruct the cycle path.

## ✅ Go Code: DFS + Cycle Reconstruction

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

const MAXN = 100005

var (
	n, m     int
	graph    = make([][]int, MAXN)
	visited  = make([]bool, MAXN)
	parent   = make([]int, MAXN)
	start, end int
)

func dfs(node, par int) bool {
	visited[node] = true
	parent[node] = par
	for _, neighbor := range graph[node] {
		if neighbor == par {
			continue
		}
		if visited[neighbor] {
			start = neighbor
			end = node
			return true
		}
		if dfs(neighbor, node) {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}

func main() {
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
	scanner.Split(bufio.ScanWords)

	readInt := func() int {
		scanner.Scan()
		val := 0
		for _, b := range scanner.Bytes() {
			val = val*10 + int(b-'0')
		}
		return val
	}

	n = readInt()
	m = readInt()

	for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
		u := readInt()
		v := readInt()
		graph[u] = append(graph[u], v)
		graph[v] = append(graph[v], u)
	}

	found := false
	for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
		if !visited[i] && dfs(i, -1) {
			found = true
			break
		}
	}

	if !found {
		fmt.Println("IMPOSSIBLE")
		return
	}

	// Reconstruct cycle
	cycle := []int{start}
	for v := end; v != start; v = parent[v] {
		cycle = append(cycle, v)
	}
	cycle = append(cycle, start)

	fmt.Println(len(cycle))
	for i := len(cycle) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
		fmt.Print(cycle[i], " ")
	}
	fmt.Println()
}
```

## 🧠 Time Complexity

- **O(n + m)**: Standard DFS traversal time.
- Space: **O(n + m)** for graph and parent tracking.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Use DFS for cycle detection in undirected graphs.
- Track parent relationships to reconstruct the cycle path.
- Avoid false positives by skipping the parent node during DFS.
