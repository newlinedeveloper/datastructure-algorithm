Awesome! Let's deep dive into **Sliding Window** and **Two Pointers** — two of the **most high-leverage DSA patterns** that appear frequently in interviews at companies like **Google, Amazon, Meta, etc.**

## 🪟 **Sliding Window Pattern**

### ✅ **When to Use Sliding Window:**
- You're dealing with **contiguous subarrays or substrings**.
- You need to **optimize from O(n²) to O(n)**.
- You're computing **sums, lengths, or counts** within a moving range.

---

### 🔁 **Common Sliding Window Types:**

| Type | Use Case | Window Size |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Fixed-size | Average/Max/Min in K-sized subarray | Constant (K) |
| Variable-size | Longest substring/subarray meeting condition | Dynamic |

---

### 🔑 **How to Identify Sliding Window Problems:**
- “Find the maximum/average of every subarray of size K”
- “Longest/shortest substring with at most K unique characters”
- “Minimum window containing all characters”
- “Find number of substrings with …”

### 🔍 **Sliding Window Problems:**

| Problem | Type | LeetCode |
|--------|------|----------|
| Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K | Fixed | [LC 643](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/) |
| Maximum in Sliding Window | Fixed (Harder) | [LC 239](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/) |
| Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | Variable | [LC 3](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) |
| Longest Repeating Character Replacement | Variable | [LC 424](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/) |
| Minimum Window Substring | Variable | [LC 76](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/) |
| Permutation in String | Variable | [LC 567](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/) |

### 🧠 **Sliding Window Template (Variable size):**
```python
left = 0
for right in range(len(s)):
    # Expand the window

    while condition_not_met:
        # Shrink the window
        left += 1

    # Update answer
```

## 👯‍♂️ **Two Pointers Pattern**

### ✅ **When to Use Two Pointers:**
- **Sorted arrays or strings**
- **Start and end indexes** involved
- Often used to **reduce nested loops** to linear time

---

### 🔁 **Common Two Pointers Use Cases:**

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Opposite ends | Move `left` and `right` toward each other |
| Same direction | One pointer moves faster/slower |
| Merging | In merge sort or merging two lists |
| Partitioning | Like in quicksort or Dutch National Flag |

---

### 🔍 **Two Pointers Problems:**

| Problem | Type | LeetCode |
|--------|------|----------|
| Two Sum II (Input array is sorted) | Opposite ends | [LC 167](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/) |
| 3Sum | Triple pointer | [LC 15](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/) |

| Valid Palindrome | Opposite ends | [LC 125](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/) |
| Merge Two Sorted Lists | Merging | [LC 21](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/) |

---

### 🧠 **Two Pointers Template (Opposite Ends):**
```python
left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
while left < right:
    if arr[left] + arr[right] == target:
        return [left, right]
    elif arr[left] + arr[right] < target:
        left += 1
    else:
        right -= 1
```

## 🔍 How to Know Which One to Use:

| Clue in Problem | Use Pattern |
|-----------------|-------------|
| “Contiguous subarray/substring” | Sliding Window |
| “Sorted array” | Two Pointers |
| “Find longest/shortest ...” | Sliding Window |
| “Start and end pointers” | Two Pointers |
| “Remove duplicates/partition array” | Two Pointers |

---

## ✅ Pro Tips:

- Always **draw the window or pointer movement** for examples.
- Try to **replace nested loops** with these patterns.
- Use **sets or maps** inside the window for string problems.
- Combine with **binary search or hash maps** if needed.

## 🪟 SLIDING WINDOW — Google Interview

### 🔍 When to Use
- **Contiguous** subarrays or substrings
- Problem asks for max/min/average/count **within a window**
- Usually has a **size K** or conditions like "at most K"

### 🧠 Core Sliding Window Variants

| Type | What Changes |
|------|--------------|
| Fixed Window | Window size stays constant (e.g., size `K`) |
| Variable Window | Window size expands/shrinks based on a condition |
