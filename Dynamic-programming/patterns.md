Great question! Google is known for asking **deep, conceptual** dynamic programming (DP) problems. They typically:
- Don't **look** like DP at first glance.
- Require **pattern recognition** and strong **problem modeling**.
- Are sometimes **combinations** of multiple DP patterns (e.g., DP + Greedy, DP + Graph, DP + Recursion with Memoization).

## üß† DP Patterns Google Loves

Here‚Äôs a curated list of **DP patterns** and the **types of problems** Google has been known to ask under each one:

---

### üîÅ 1. **Fibonacci-Style / Recurrence**
These are usually entry-level but form the **base for follow-ups**.

- **Example Problems:**
  - Climbing Stairs (LeetCode #70)
  - Decode Ways (LeetCode #91)
  - Ways to Make Change (like LeetCode #518 or HackerRank)
  
‚û°Ô∏è *Google may use these as warmups or for interns/new grads.*

---

### üß≥ 2. **0/1 Knapsack & Subset Variants**
These are more complex, often wrapped in disguise.

- **Example Problems:**
  - Partition Equal Subset Sum (LeetCode #416)
  - Target Sum (LeetCode #494)
  - Subset Sum with conditions
  - Pick k items to maximize profit with constraints

‚û°Ô∏è *Expect questions involving choosing/not choosing elements under constraints.*

- **Example Problems:**
  - Coin Change I & II (LeetCode #322, #518)
  - Integer Break (LeetCode #343)
  - Rod Cutting (GeeksForGeeks)

‚û°Ô∏è *Google loves variation-rich problems where items can be reused.*

---

### üìè 4. **LCS / Edit Distance / String Matching**
Very common in interviews due to their real-world applications (e.g., spell check, DNA, diff tools).

- **Example Problems:**
  - Longest Common Subsequence (LeetCode #1143)
  - Edit Distance (LeetCode #72)
  - Regular Expression Matching (LeetCode #10)

---

### ‚õìÔ∏è 6. **LIS / DP on Subsequences**
Used in optimization scenarios with ordering.

- **Example Problems:**
  - Longest Increasing Subsequence (LeetCode #300)
  - Russian Doll Envelopes (LeetCode #354)
  - Number of LIS (LeetCode #673)
  - Max Sum Increasing Subsequence

‚û°Ô∏è *They like to wrap these with real-world constraints (e.g., stacking envelopes, boxes).*

---

### üß† 7. **DP + Bitmask / State Machine**
These are more advanced and often asked for senior/experienced roles.

- **Example Problems:**
  - Paint House (LeetCode #256)
  - Paint House III (LeetCode #1473) ‚Äì multiple states
  - Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
  - Minimum Cost to Merge Stones (LeetCode #1000)

‚û°Ô∏è *Bitmask DP is a Google favorite when tracking combinations or permutations.*

---

### üå≥ 8. **DP on Trees**
Used to test recursion + DP understanding.

- **Example Problems:**
  - House Robber III (LeetCode #337)
  - Diameter of Tree (LeetCode #543)
  - Maximum Path Sum (LeetCode #124)

‚û°Ô∏è *Expect post-order traversal combined with DP memoization.*

### üîÄ 9. **DP + Greedy / Sliding Window Hybrid**
Google likes mixed patterns that test multiple skills.

- **Example Problems:**
  - Jump Game II (LeetCode #45) ‚Äì DP or Greedy
  - Maximum Subarray (LeetCode #53) ‚Äì Kadane‚Äôs Algo
  - Minimum Number of Refueling Stops (LeetCode #871)

‚û°Ô∏è *They may ask why you choose DP over greedy or vice versa.*
