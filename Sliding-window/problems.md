## 🔍 How to Identify a Sliding Window Pattern

Use the **Sliding Window** pattern when:
- You're working with **contiguous subarrays or substrings**.
- The problem mentions "**at most K elements**", "**exactly K elements**", "**longest/shortest window**", or "**maximum sum/average**".
- You want to **optimize a brute-force O(n²)** solution to **O(n)**.

## 🧠 Sliding Window Pattern Variants

| Pattern | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| 1. Fixed-size window | Size `k` is constant | Max sum of `k` elements |
| 2. Dynamic/Variable-size window | Window size changes based on conditions | Longest substring with K distinct characters |
| 3. Sliding with frequency map | Use hash map for character counts | Anagram or permutation problems |
| 4. Sliding with prefix sum | Use cumulative sum for range queries | Count subarrays with given sum |
| 5. Sliding with deques | Maintain min/max efficiently | Sliding window max problem |

## 🧪 Template for Fixed-Size Sliding Window

```python
def max_sum_k_elements(nums, k):
    max_sum = cur_sum = sum(nums[:k])
    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        cur_sum += nums[i] - nums[i-k]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, cur_sum)
    return max_sum
```

## 🧪 Template for Variable-Size Sliding Window

```python
def longest_substring_k_distinct(s, k):
    left = 0
    freq = {}
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        freq[s[right]] = freq.get(s[right], 0) + 1

        while len(freq) > k:
            freq[s[left]] -= 1
            if freq[s[left]] == 0:
                del freq[s[left]]
            left += 1

        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

## 🛠️ Tips for Google Interviews

| Tip | Why It Helps |
|-----|--------------|
| 💡 Use sets or hash maps to track character/window state | Avoids extra loops |
| 🎯 Carefully handle shrinking the window | It’s the trickiest part |
| 🧠 Think "when is the window valid?" vs. "when to shrink it" | Especially for min/max window |
| 🧪 Dry-run small examples | Catch off-by-one bugs or corner cases |
| 🔄 Combine with frequency map, prefix sum, or deque | Many Google problems are **hybrid patterns** |
