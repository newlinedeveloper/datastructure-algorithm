### üîÅ **1. Subset/Subsequence Generation**
**Pattern**: Include or exclude the current element.

**Key Idea**: At each step, choose to either include or exclude the element.

**Classic Problems**:
- Generate all subsets of a set (Power set)
- Subsets with duplicates
- Subsets that sum to K

```python
def subsets(nums, index, path, res):
    if index == len(nums):
        res.append(path[:])
        return
    path.append(nums[index])
    subsets(nums, index + 1, path, res)
    path.pop()
    subsets(nums, index + 1, path, res)
```

---

### ‚ôªÔ∏è **2. Permutations & Combinations**
**Pattern**: Try each unused element at every position.

**Key Idea**: Swap elements or use a visited array to generate all possible orders.

**Classic Problems**:
- All permutations of a list
- Next permutation
- Letter case permutations

```python
def permute(nums, path, used, res):
    if len(path) == len(nums):
        res.append(path[:])
        return
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if not used[i]:
            used[i] = True
            path.append(nums[i])
            permute(nums, path, used, res)
            path.pop()
            used[i] = False
```

```python
def solveNQueens(row, n, board, res):
    if row == n:

        return
    for col in range(n):
        if isSafe(board, row, col):
            board[row][col] = 'Q'
            solveNQueens(row + 1, n, board, res)
            board[row][col] = '.'
```
