## üîç HOW TO IDENTIFY BINARY SEARCH PATTERNS

Use Binary Search when:
- You are asked to **search for an element or condition** in a sorted structure.
- The problem involves **finding boundaries**: first/last/peak/transition point.
- The function or array follows a **monotonic (non-decreasing/non-increasing)** behavior.
- You are **optimizing/minimizing/maximizing a result**.

## üß† COMMON BINARY SEARCH PATTERNS

| Pattern | Use Case | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 1. Classic Binary Search | Find element in sorted array | `search in array` |
| 2. Left/Right Bound Search | First or last occurrence | `first/last position` |
| 3. Binary Search on Answer (Parametric Search) | Min/max value that satisfies condition | `min eating speed` |
| 4. Search in Rotated Sorted Array | Array is rotated | `rotated sorted array` |
| 5. Search on Function/Predicate | Monotonic function or condition | `koko eating bananas` |
| 6. Peak Finding | Find peak or local max/min | `peak element` |
| 7. Bitwise Binary Search | On numbers, like XOR/min/max operations | `single element in sorted array` |

## üß† BINARY SEARCH ON ANSWER TEMPLATE

Used for problems like Koko Eating Bananas, Shipping Packages, etc.
```python
def binary_search_on_answer():
    low, high = min_possible, max_possible
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if is_valid(mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    return low
```

## üí° TIPS FOR GOOGLE BINARY SEARCH QUESTIONS

| Tip | Why |
|-----|-----|
| Think in terms of **conditions rather than elements** | Many problems ask for minimal/maximal satisfying values |
| Prefer **while left < right** to avoid off-by-one errors | Cleaner in boundary searches |
| Always consider **edge cases**: empty input, 1 element, duplicates |
| Binary search can apply to **virtual arrays or search spaces** | Even when array isn‚Äôt given |
